## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git

### Cloning the Repository

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Clone the repository using the following command:

   Replace `yourusername` with the actual username or organization name where the repository is hosted.

3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd causal-attribution-analysis
   ```

### Setting up the Virtual Environment

1. Create a virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     python -m venv venv
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```
     python3 -m venv venv
     ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

### Installing Dependencies

1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated (you should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your command prompt).

2. Install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

This will install all necessary dependencies for the project.

### Deactivating the Virtual Environment

When you're done working on the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment by running:
